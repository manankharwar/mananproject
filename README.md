### Hi there, I'm Manan - aka [NurturingMachines][website] ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a student pursuing Engineering Physics here at McMaster University!!

### List of projects I've worked on:
[1. Unity3D Game Dev][GameDev]

      â€¢ First Unity3D project focused towards scripting and building working functionality
      â€¢ Added Models, Materials, Textures, buttons, & aVideo Player Element 
      
[2. Design of a Hand Prosthesis][HandProsthesis]

      â€¢ I and along with my 3 team members designed the forefinger-thumb portion of the full-right hand prosthesis
      â€¢ An approximation of the range of motion for both the forefinger-tip and thumb-tip and the intersection represents the point-of-contact

[3. iRobot Roomba][Roomba]

      â€¢ Re-Designing iRobot to make it climb stairs using Autodesk Inventor
      â€¢ Used Inventor to create the design and 3D printed a scaled-down model for our presentation
      â€¢ Made a separate attachment that extends to the original Roomba design with a working functionality for the stair-case model

[4. Algorand Blockchain Cryptocurrency][Algorand]

      â€¢ Results from the model used to predict the prices with 90% accuracy
      â€¢ Integrated Algorandâ€™s blockchain services in desktop and mobile applications
      â€¢ Generated unsigned transactions and added node to the blockchain using Algorandâ€™s Sandbox & Node.js in real-time
      
[6. UX Design Concept][UXDesign]

      â€¢ I created a user flow website for the newly designed McMaster Design League using Adobe xD
      â€¢ Extensive prototyping and wireframing
